# For this assignment, I want to try to not be all over the place with my code. I'll try my best to add comments and explain everything I'm doing.
# First, let's create our Connect 4 board.

    # Let's create two variables just in case we want to change the size in the future

    cols = 7
    arr = [['.' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

# Here's a simple print function to make sure it's right
# We'll also add column numbers to make the choice easier for whoever is playing

        print(' '.join(row))
    print(''.join(['â€”' for _ in range((cols*2) - 1)]))
    print(' '.join([str(i) for i in range(cols)]))

# Now, let's create symbols for two players
# Player 1 wil have 0 and Player 2 will have X
# We'll need to get input from the user and then insert it appropriately into our board
